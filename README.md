Handwritten Text Recognition Using CNNs
Overview
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop an effective model for recognizing and digitizing handwritten text. The goal is to automate the process of converting handwritten documents into machine-readable text, improving accuracy and efficiency over traditional OCR methods.

Features
Deep Learning Approach: Utilizes CNNs for advanced feature extraction and text recognition.
Robust Dataset: Trained on a comprehensive dataset of handwritten text samples to ensure high model performance.
End-to-End Pipeline: From image preprocessing to character prediction and text reconstruction.
Flexible and Scalable: Can be adapted for various languages and text styles.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-text-recognition.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
